## LESSON OBJECTIVES

1.  Describe the purpose of using R Markdown as a communication and workflow tool
2.  Incorporate Markdown syntax into documents
3.  Communicate the process and findings of an analysis session in the style of a report

## USE OF R STUDIO & R MARKDOWN SO FAR...

1.  Write code
2.  Document that code
3.  Generate PDFs of code and its outputs
4.  Integrate with Git/GitHub for version control

## BASIC R MARKDOWN DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

1. **YAML Header** surrounded by --- on top and bottom
    + YAML templates include options for html, pdf, word, markdown, and interactive
    + More information on formatting the YAML header can be found in the cheat sheet
2. **R Code Chunks** surrounded by ``` on top and bottom
    + Create using `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
    + Can be named {r name} to facilitate navigation and autoreferencing
    + Chunk options allow for flexibility when the code runs and when the document is knitted
3. **Text** with formatting options for readability in knitted document

## THE KNITTING PROCESS
-   The knitting sequence
    ![knitting](../lessons/img/rmarkdownflow.png)

* Knitting commands in code chunks:
 - `include = FALSE` - code is run, but neither code nor results appear in knitted file
 - `echo = FALSE`    - code not included in knitted file, but results are
 - `eval = FALSE`    - code is not run in the knitted file
 - `message = FALSE` - messages do not appear in knitted file
 - `warning = FALSE` - warnings do not appear...
 - `fig.cap = "..."` - adds a caption to graphical results


## WHAT ELSE CAN R MARKDOWN DO?

 * Languages other than R...
 * Various outputs...

## WHY R MARKDOWN?

<Fill in our discussion below with bullet points. Use italics and bold for emphasis (hint: use the cheat sheets or `Help` →`Markdown Quick Reference` to figure out how to make bold and italic text).> 

+ Combine code and formatted text
+ Reproducibility and collaboration
+ Run code in chunks/intervals
+ Embedded tables and plots that are easily updated
+ Version control
+ User friendly, low learning curve

1. **Bold**
2. *Italic*

## TEXT EDITING CHALLENGE

Create a table below that details the example datasets we have been using in class. The first column should contain the names of the datasets and the second column should include some relevant information about the datasets. (Hint: use the cheat sheets to figure out how to make a table in Rmd)

File Name                     | Description
----------------------------  | ---------------------
EPAair_O3_NC2019_raw.csv      | O3 Concentrations in North Carolina, 2019
NTL-LTER_Lake_Carbon_Raw.csv  | NTL LTER Lake: Carbon Data



## R CHUNK EDITING CHALLENGE

### Installing packages

Create an R chunk below that installs the package `knitr`. Instead of commenting out the code, customize the chunk options such that the code is not evaluated (i.e., not run).
```{r - knitr, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

install.packages("knitr")

```

### Setup

Create an R chunk below called "setup" that checks your working directory, loads the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `knitr`, and sets a ggplot theme. Remember that you need to disable R throwing a message, which contains a check mark that cannot be knitted.

Load the NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw dataset, display the head of the dataset, and set the date column to a date format.

Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but is not displayed in the final document.

```{r - setup, include=FALSE}
#working directory
getwd()

#load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)

#theme
mytheme <- theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top")
theme_set(mytheme)

#load the data
NTL_LTER_Raw <- read.csv("/Users/britneypepper/Desktop//ENVIRON 872 and L/GitHubRepositories/Environmental_Data_Analytics_2022/Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw.csv")

#head of the dataset
colnames(NTL_LTER_Raw)
head(NTL_LTER_Raw, n=5)

#set date format
NTL_LTER_Raw$sampledate <- as.Date(NTL_LTER_Raw$sampledate, format = "%m/%d/%y")

```


### Data Exploration, Wrangling, and Visualization

Create an R chunk below to create a processed dataset do the following operations:

-   Include all columns except lakeid, depth_id, and comments
-   Include only surface samples (depth = 0 m)
-   Drop rows with missing data

Create a second R chunk to create a summary dataset with the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of total nitrogen concentrations for each lake. Create a second summary dataset that is identical except that it evaluates total phosphorus. Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but not displayed in the final document.

Create a third R chunk that uses the function `kable` in the knitr package to display two tables: one for the summary dataframe for total N and one for the summary dataframe of total P. Use the `caption = " "` code within that function to title your tables. Customize the chunk options such that the final table is displayed but not the code used to generate the table.

Create a fourth and fifth R chunk that generates two plots (one in each chunk): one for total N over time with different colors for each lake, and one with the same setup but for total P. Decide which geom option will be appropriate for your purpose, and select a color palette that is visually pleasing and accessible. Customize the chunk options such that the final figures are displayed but not the code used to generate the figures. In addition, customize the chunk options such that the figures are aligned on the left side of the page. Lastly, add a fig.cap chunk option to add a caption (title) to your plot that will display underneath the figure.

```{r - Process the data}
#Removing columns of data
NTL_LTER_Wrangle1 <- NTL_LTER_Raw %>%
  select(lakename, year4, daynum, sampledate, depth, tn_ug, tp_ug, nh34, no23, po4)

#Surface examples with only depth = 0m
NTL_LTER_Wrangle2 <- filter(NTL_LTER_Wrangle1, depth == 0)

#Remove rows with missing data
NTL_LTER_Wrangle3 <- na.omit(NTL_LTER_Wrangle2)

```


```{r - summary dataset, include = FALSE}

#Compute summary stats for total nitrogen
ntl.lter.summary.tn <- NTL_LTER_Wrangle3 %>%
  group_by(lakename) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_tn_ug = mean(tn_ug),
    min_tn_ug = min(tn_ug),
    max_tn_ug = max(tn_ug),
    sd_tn_ug = sd(tn_ug)
)

#Compute summary stats for total phosphorous
ntl.lter.summary.tp <- NTL_LTER_Wrangle3 %>%
  group_by(lakename) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_tp_ug = mean(tp_ug),
    min_tp_ug = min(tp_ug),
    max_tp_ug = max(tp_ug),
    sd_tp_ug = sd(tp_ug)
)

```


```{r - kable, echo = FALSE}

kable(ntl.lter.summary.tn, caption = "Table 2: Surface Samples: Total Nitrogen")

kable(ntl.lter.summary.tp, caption = "Table 3: Surface Samples: Total Phosphorous")


```

```{r - Plot 1, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='left', out.width="85%", fig.cap = "Total Nitrogen"}

ggplot(data=NTL_LTER_Wrangle3, aes(x=sampledate,y=tn_ug,color=lakename)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se=F) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") + 
  labs(
    title ='Total N over time',
    x = 'Date',
    y = expression(paste('Total N (',mu,'g)')),
    color = "Lake")


```

```{r - Plot 2, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align='left', out.width="85%", fig.cap = "Total Phosphorus"}
ggplot(data=NTL_LTER_Wrangle3, aes(x=sampledate,y=tp_ug,color=lakename)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se=F) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(
    title ='Total P over time',
    x = 'Date',
    y = expression(paste('Total P (',mu,'g)')),
    color = "Lake")

```

### Communicating results

Write a paragraph describing your findings from the R coding challenge above. This should be geared toward an educated audience but one that is not necessarily familiar with the dataset. Then insert a horizontal rule below the paragraph. Below the horizontal rule, write another paragraph describing the next steps you might take in analyzing this dataset. What questions might you be able to answer, and what analyses would you conduct to answer those questions?


When looking at the graphs, it appears that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in each lake follow the same trends. Based off the graphs, when nitrogen increase, phosphorus appears to increase as well. While the phosphorus trends are not as dramatic as the nitrogen, it still follows the pattern. Although the trends in the data appear to be consistent, the year 1996-1998 has a much greater standard deviation in the data for those years. When looking at the tables, you can see that the nitrogen concentrations are greater overall with much wider standard deviations in the data set than phosphorus. 

-----------------

The next steps I might take in analyzying the dataset would be to do linear models to analyze the change in conentrations over the years. It would be able to show whether or not we are increasing the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration levels as the years progress. I also think it might help to look at an individual year to analyze season changes in concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus for each lake. I would be interested in seeing if there are seasonal trends in concentration levels in each lake. It would help our understanding of when these elements end up in our water systems and provide some insight as to how they end up there (for example, runoff). 




## KNIT YOUR PDF
When you have completed the above steps, try knitting your PDF to see if all of the formatting options you specified turned out as planned. This may take some troubleshooting.

## OTHER R MARKDOWN CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

We have covered the basics in class today, but R Markdown offers many customization options. A word of caution: customizing templates will often require more interaction with LaTeX and installations on your computer, so be ready to troubleshoot issues.

Customization options for pdf output include: 

* Table of contents
* Number sections
* Control default size of figures
* Citations
* Template (more info [here](http://jianghao.wang/post/2017-12-08-rmarkdown-templates/))

pdf_document:  
    toc: true  
    number_sections: true  
    fig_height: 3  
    fig_width: 4  
    citation_package: natbib  
    template:
